## Installation

Install the required packages using `environment.yaml`.

### Using `environment.yaml`

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate qwen2
pip install qwen-vl-utils
pip install flash-attn==2.5.8 --no-build-isolation
```

**Note:** You should install flash-attn after installing the other packages.

## Dataset Preparation

The script requires a dataset formatted according to the LLaVA specification. The dataset should be a JSON file where each entry contains information about conversations and images. Ensure that the image paths in the dataset match the provided `--image_folder`.<br>

**When using a multi-image dataset, the image tokens should all be `<image>`, and the image file names should have been in a list.**
**Please see the example below and follow format your data.**

<summary>Example for single image dataset</summary>

```json
[
  {
    "id": "000000033471",
    "image": "000000033471.jpg",
    "conversations": [
      {
        "from": "human",
        "value": "<image>\nWhat are the colors of the bus in the image?"
      },
      {
        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "The bus in the image is white and red."
      },
      {
        "from": "human",
        "value": "What feature can be seen on the back of the bus?"
      },
      {
        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "The back of the bus features an advertisement."
      },
      {
        "from": "human",
        "value": "Is the bus driving down the street or pulled off to the side?"
      },
      {
        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "The bus is driving down the street, which is crowded with people and other vehicles."
      }
    ]
  }
  ...
]
```

      },
      {
        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "Yes, It the perspective of the camera is different."
      }
    ]
  }
  ...
]
```

<details>
<summary>Example for video dataset</summary>

```json
[
  {
    "id": "sample1",
    "video": "sample1.mp4",
    "conversations": [
      {
        "from": "human",
        "value": "<video>\nWhat is going on in this video?"
      },
      {
        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "A man is walking down the road."
      }
    ]
  }
  ...
]
```

**Note:** Qwen2-VL uses a video as a sequential of images.

## Training

To run the training script, use the following command:

### Full Finetuning

```bash
bash scripts/finetune.sh
```

### Full Finetuning with 8-bit

```bash
bash scripts/finetune_8bit.sh
```

This script will finetune the model with 8bit-adamw and fp8 model dtype. If you run out of vram, you could use this.

### Finetune with LoRA

If you want to train only the language model with LoRA and perform full training for the vision model:

```bash
bash scripts/finetune_lora.sh
```

If you want to train both the language model and the vision model with LoRA:

```bash
bash scripts/finetune_lora_vision.sh
```

**IMPORTANT:** If you want to tune the `embed_token` with LoRA, You need to tune `lm_head` together.
**Note:** Freezing LLM would only work without LoRA (including vision_model LoRA).

### Train with video dataset

You can train the model using a video dataset. However, Qwen2-VL processes videos as a sequence of images, so youâ€™ll need to select specific frames and treat them as multiple images for training. You can set LoRA configs and use for LoRA too.

```bash
bash scripts/finetune_video.sh
```

**Note:** When training with video, it just as multi-image so you should adjust the `max_pixels` for maximum resolution and `fps` based on the available VRAM.

If you run out of vram, you can use [zero3_offload](./scripts/zero3_offload.json) instead of [zero3](./scripts/zero3_offload.json). However, using zero3 is preferred.

#### Merge LoRA Weights

```
bash scripts/merge_lora.sh
```

**Note:** Remember to replace the paths in `finetune.sh` or `finetune_lora.sh` with your specific paths. (Also in `merge_lora.sh` when using LoRA.)

#### Image Resolution for performance boost

The model supprots a wide range of resolution inputs. By default, it uses the native resolution for input.
For better performance using native or higer pixel numbers are recommended, however it takes too much memory and computation time for large images. So you could adjust the pixel numbers for it.
The model splits the image into `token * 28 * 28` so you could just change the the token_num part in the script. <br>
For example:

```
min_pixels = 256 * 28 * 28
max_pixels = 1280 * 28 * 28
```

**Note:** For video, the you don't have to set like this, you could just set the maximum resolution for it.

#### Issue for libcudnn error

```
Could not load library libcudnn_cnn_train.so.8. Error: /usr/local/cuda-12.1/lib/libcudnn_cnn_train.so.8: undefined symbol: _ZN5cudnn3cnn34layerNormFwd_execute_internal_implERKNS_7backend11VariantPackEP11CUstream_stRNS0_18LayerNormFwdParamsERKNS1_20NormForwardOperationEmb, version libcudnn_cnn_infer.so.8
```

You could run `unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH` for this error.
You could see this [issue](https://github.com/andimarafioti/florence2-finetuning/issues/2)

## Inference

**Note:** You should use the merged weight when trained with LoRA.

### Gradio Infernce (WebUI)

1. Install gradio

```
pip install gradio
```

2. Launch app

```
python -m src.serve.app \
    --model-path /path/to/merged/weight
```

You can launch gradio based demo with this command. This can also set some other generation configs like `repetition_penalty`, `temperature` etc.

## TODO

- [x] Support for video data
- [x] Add demo for multi-image and video
- [ ] Support for dyanmic truncation
